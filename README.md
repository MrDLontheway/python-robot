# simpleChatBot

Developed the simple chat bot using Python and AIML(Artificial Intilegence Markup Language).

#What is AIML?

AIML was developed by Richard Wallace. He made a bot called A.L.I.C.E. (Artificial Linguistics Internet Computer Entity) which won several artificial intelligence awards. Interestingly, one of the Turing tests to look for artificial intelligence is to have a human chat with a bot through a text interface for several minutes and see if they thought it was a human. AIML is a form of XML that defines rules for matching patterns and determining responses.

AIML as 4 Basic Tags:

    <aiml> - defines the beginning and end of a AIML document.

    <category> - defines the unit of knowledge in Alicebot's knowledge base.

    <pattern> - defines the pattern to match what a user may input to an Alicebot.

    <template> - defines the response of an Alicebot to user's input.

other tags reference will be avilable in the reference link : http://www.alicebot.org/documentation/aiml-reference.html

python module for the running AIML : 'Pip install AIML'
