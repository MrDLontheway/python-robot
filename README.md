# simpleChatBot

Developed the simple chat bot using Python and AIML(Artificial Intilegence Markup Language).

#What is AIML?

AIML was developed by Richard Wallace. He made a bot called A.L.I.C.E. (Artificial Linguistics Internet Computer Entity) which won several artificial intelligence awards. Interestingly, one of the Turing tests to look for artificial intelligence is to have a human chat with a bot through a text interface for several minutes and see if they thought it was a human. AIML is a form of XML that defines rules for matching patterns and determining responses.

For a full AIML primer, check out Alice Bot's AIML Primer. You can also learn more about AIML and what it is capable of on the AIML Wikipedia page. We will create the AIML files first and then use Python to give it some life.
